# GoProg (Working Title)

## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a prototype of a game where the player learns simple programming.
This could be used as an educational tool for children, as well as a recruitment tool.

## Game Engine
This project utilized the game engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). Our use of it is detailed on the [Wiki](https://github.com/olav89/GoProg/wiki/Godot)

**Important: To run the game you need to compile a custom version of Godot found [here](https://github.com/olav89/godot/tree/bind-parser). The branch bind-parser adds functionality to GDScript and without it your game might crash.**
